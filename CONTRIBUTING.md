# How to contribute

All contributions are welcome, though changes that make substantial changes to the core components not in line with outstanding TODOs will be reviewed more closely and will likely have to wait for major versions. If you would like to propose a change, you can open up a pull request against this repo and I will try to review it quickly.

# Getting started

This repository uses JedWatson's excellent [react-component-gulp-tasks](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-component-gulp-tasks). A thorough explanation of the gulp tasks to run the react-baduk code are available there. For the simplest purposes, it's good enough to clone and `gulp dev`.

The basic workflow for contributing should more or less look as follows:

- Fork
- Work on feature branch
- Run `eslint`
- Rebase if necessary to cleanup code and merge against modern master
- Open a PR

Good luck and have fun!
