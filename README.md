# React Baduk [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-baduk.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-baduk) #

A controlled component for an SVG Go board with some variants.

Currently this exposes three components, `Baduk` (for playing a game) `BadukBoard` and `Piece`. It also exposes the class `BadukGame` which models the state of a game.

# TODO #
A few things to do

## High priority ##

* Default styles (see example styles for a basic template)
* Make star point locations adaptive to board size

## Lower priority ##
* Handicap for game component
* Puzzle component
* Variant pieces for move annotations
* Board from notation
* Hover styles on board labels
* Smarter click detection (single click layer and get mouse coordinates?)
* Pre-commit linter
* Tests
* Rule variants?
* Label direction and location
